Login to Circle CI with your github user. 

I updated my old application (which was previously just on 
every git commit doing a heroku update) to use the CircleCI.

Add the CircleCI config.yml file with heroku orbs (view config.yml)

Add environment variables in CircleCI from: 
Project Settings -> Environment Variables.

Needed envs were:
HEROKU_API_KEY=XXX
HEROKU_APP_NAME=ubuntu-package-viewer

Wait for the deployment process to finish and view application here:
